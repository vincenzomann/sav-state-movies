Implement a movie streaming dashboard using **TypeScript** and **React**.
Would fetch from API https://sav.state/movies if it set up, instead it uses mock data and implements a basic client side search.
I have tweaked the mock data file to include a couple of links to real image links for testing purposes.

### Scripts:

`npm i` - Install package.json dependencies

`npm start` - Compile and run the project on localhost

### Endpoints: 
|url|Page|Description|
|---|---|---|
|/|Dashboard|Displays movie genres and search results|
|/:id|Details|Displays movie details|
